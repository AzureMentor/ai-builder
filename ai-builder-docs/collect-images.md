# Collect images

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In order to train an object detection model to recognize your items, you will need to gather images containing these items. Adhere to guidelines on the image quantity and quality to get an AI model that performs well.

## Format and size

The images you’ll feed your object detection model need these characteristics:

- **Format**:
  - JPG
  -.png
  - BMP
  
- **Size**:
  - 6 MB maximum for training
  - minimum width / height of 256 pixels x 256 pixels

## Data quantity and data balance

The most important thing is to upload enough images to train your AI model. We recommend at least 50 images per product for the training set as a starting point. With fewer images, there's a strong risk that your model will learn concepts that are in fact noise or irrelevant details. Training your model with more images will generally increase the accuracy of prediction results.

Another consideration is that you should make sure that your data is balanced. For instance, having 500 images for one item and 50 images for another item will produce an imbalanced training dataset, causing the model to be more accurate in predicting one item than another. You're likely to see better results if you maintain at least a 1:2 ratio between the item with the fewest images and the item with the most images. For example, if the item with the greatest number of images has 500 images, the item with the least images needs to have at least 250 images for training.

## Use more diverse images

Provide images that are representative of what will be submitted to the model during normal use. For example, if you're training a model that recognizes apples, your model might not be as accurate if you only train images of apples in plates but make predictions on images of apples on trees. Including a variety of images will make sure that your model isn't biased and can generalize well. Below are some ways you can make your training set more diverse.

### Background

Provide images of your object in front of different backgrounds (that is, fruit on plate versus fruit in grocery bag). Photos in context are better than photos in front of neutral backgrounds because they provide more information for the classifier.

### Lighting

Provide images with varied lighting (that is, taken with flash, high exposure, and so on), especially if the images used for prediction have different lighting. It is also helpful to include images with varied saturation, hue, and brightness. These are all settings that your device cameras allows you to set.

### Object size

Provide images in which the objects are of varied sizes, capturing different parts of the object. For example, a photo of bunches of bananas and a closeup of a single banana. Different sizing helps the AI generalize better.

### Camera angle

Provide images taken with different camera angles. If all your photos are taken with a set of fixed cameras (such as surveillance cameras), make sure you assign a different label to every camera even if they capture the same objects to avoid overfitting—modeling unrelated objects (such as lampposts) as the key feature.

### Unexpected results

Sometimes the AI model incorrectly learns characteristics that your images have in common. For example, if you are creating an AI for apples versus citrus, and use images of apples in hands and of citrus on white plates, the AI model might train for hands versus white plates instead of apples versus citrus.

To correct this, use the above guidance on training with more varied images: provide images with different angles, backgrounds, object size, groups, and other variants.

## Need help collecting images?

You can leverage [Trove](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/trove?activetab=pivot1:primaryr3) to gather images for your projects. Trove is an app that connects you directly with photo takers, allowing you to collect more relevant and accurate photos. Using Trove, you can post your project descriptions, outline the types of photos you are looking for, and only approve the photos that you want. Trove provides licensing and privacy frameworks, so you can collect high quality data responsibly and safely.
