# Use the business card reader in model-driven apps

 The business card reader takes a photo or loads an image from the local device, and then scans it to find a business card. If it detects a business card, it extracts the information it finds.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about model-driven apps, see [What are model-driven apps in PowerApps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)?

## Licensing requirements

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your PowerApps or Flow licenses. For information about license capacity, pricing, and restrictions, see [AI Builder licensing](/ai-builder/administer-licensing).

## Role requirements

Users need to be entitled to the **common data service user** role to be able to consume the business card reader.

## Add the business card reader

Add the business card reader to an existing contact or lead form in the form editor, and through binding to a placeholder **SingleLine.Text** or **Multiple** field.

1. Select the placeholder field, and then select **Properties**.
2. Select the **Controls** tab.
3. Select **Add Control...**.
4. Select **AI Builder Business Card Control**.
